Preheat oven to 425°F. Slice @broccoli{2%lb} into florets and add to a large bowl. Generously drizzle with @extra-virgin olive oil or neutral oil{} and sprinkle with @ranch seasoning{1%oz packet}. Toss with your hands until evenly coated.

Divide between two sheet pans, spacing evenly and turning florets flat-side down. Bake for ~{20-25%minutes} until broccoli is tender and starting to brown.

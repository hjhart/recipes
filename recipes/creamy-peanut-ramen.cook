title: Creamy Peanut Ramen
---

**Ingredients:**

- 2 packs of instant ramen
- 2 eggs
- 2 tablespoons kewpie mayo
- 2 tablespoons peanut butter
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- Spring onion, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1/2 cup of boiled organic water (from the ramen)

**Garnish:**

- Spring onion, finely chopped
- Chili oil
- Sesame seeds

**Instructions:**

1. Start by cooking the instant ramen in the boiled organic water according to the package instructions. Once cooked, drain the ramen and set it aside.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the ramen seasoning (from the ramen packages), eggs, kewpie mayo, peanut butter, minced garlic, chopped spring onion, and sesame oil. Thoroughly mix these ingredients until they form a creamy sauce.
3. Gradually add the 1/2 cup of boiled organic water to the sauce mixture. Stir well to combine. This will help thin out the sauce and make it easier to coat the noodles.
4. Add the cooked and drained ramen noodles to the sauce. Toss the noodles in the sauce until they are evenly coated.
5. To serve, garnish the creamy peanut butter ramen with finely chopped spring onion, a drizzle of chili oil for some heat, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds for added texture and flavor.

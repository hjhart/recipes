Butter or spray one side of a #pie iron{} with @Pam or squeezable butter{}. Place a slice of @white bread{} on the pie iron. Spread @peanut butter{} on the bread. Add a layer of @chocolate chips or Hershey's chocolate{}, cover with @mini marshmallows{}, and top with @banana slices{}.

Cover with a second slice of @white bread{} (buttered side out). Close the pie iron and cook over hot coals, flipping once, until warm and crisp on both sides, ~{3-5%minutes} per side depending on coal heat.

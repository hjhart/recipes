Preheat oven to 400°F. Shake the @full-fat coconut milk{1%16-oz can} (or use half broth) to break up the cream. Add @gluten-free penne pasta{16%oz} to a #9x13 baking dish{} and spread it out. Add the coconut milk, @garlic cloves{2} (minced), @onion powder{1%tsp}, @dried oregano{1/2%tsp}, and @marinara sauce{1%20-oz jar}. Mix well to evenly combine.

Sprinkle @shredded mozzarella{1.5%cups} over the top, then cover tightly with foil. Bake ~{35-40%minutes}. Remove foil and broil ~{90%seconds} until cheese is bubbling and golden.

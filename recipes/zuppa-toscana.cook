Cook the @Italian sausage{1%lb} (mild or hot) in a large #soup pot{} over medium-high heat, breaking it into crumbles as it browns.

Add the chopped @Vidalia onion{1}, @garlic cloves{2} (or @minced garlic{1%tbsp}), @salt{1/2%tsp}, @black pepper{1/2%tsp}, and @red pepper flakes{1/2%tsp} to the pot and sauté until fragrant.

Lower the heat to medium and add the sliced @russet potatoes{2}, @chicken broth{8%oz} and @water{1%quart} to the pot. If using @chicken bouillon{1}, add it now.

Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and cook for about ~{15%minutes}, or until the potatoes are fork-tender, stirring occasionally.

Stir in the @flour{2%tsp} or @cornstarch{2%tsp} slurry to thicken the broth slightly, letting it simmer for a minute or two.

Reduce the heat to low and add the chopped @kale or Swiss chard{2%cups} along with cooked @bacon{4 slices}, stirring until the greens wilt.

Stir in the tempered @heavy whipping cream{1%cup} and mix until well combined, transforming the soup into a creamy texture.

Taste and adjust the seasonings if necessary. Serve warm with crusty bread or garlic knots.

Poke holes in @potatoes{} (one per person), rub with oil, and bake at 400°F for ~{1%hour} until tender. Cut in half and scoop the pulp into a bowl.

Mix the pulp with @scallions{}, @sour cream{}, @bacon{} (cooked and crumbled), @grated Cheddar cheese{}, and @salt and pepper{} to taste. Place the filling back into the potato skins.

Bake again until heated through and cheese is bubbly.

title: Cheesy Broccoli Orzo
---

In a pan over a medium heat, fry @white onion{1%small}, finely chopped, in @olive oil{1-2%tbsp} until softened.

After about ~{2%minutes}, add @orzo{400%g}, @broccoli{1%head} florets (stalks removed), @vegetable stock{1%cube}, and approximately @hot water{750%ml} (use more if necessary). Season with @crushed black pepper{} to taste. Mix then cover with a lid and leave to reduce for ~{10-12%minutes}.

Remove the lid and mix the orzo (by this point, the stock should be reduced and the orzo cooked). Stir in @cheddar cheese{150%g}, grated, and place the lid back on but off the heat to allow the cheese to melt.
